# MoU4Greece
Simulator of the Memorandum of Understanding suffered by Greece

The 2010 MoU signed by Greece after the debt crisis consists in a set of economic measures, mostly tax increments 
and government expendirures reductions to drive the sovereign debt to a sustainable path.

The result has been, seven years later, a dramatic contraction in national income, unsustainable levels of 
unemployment, and unsustainable debt. 

Some economists published a paper in a top macroeconomics journal showing that fiscal adjustment was not the probable
cure. The paper was titled "Fiscal Discipline and Defaults". It was authored by me, and to co-authors; Pau S. Pujolas and Jose L. Torres. The paper can be downloaded from the Review of economic Dynamics site at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109420251630045X, however a close draft is at your disposal in this repository in a pdf file named RED.pdf

In that paper you can find the logic of the ecuations that populate the python files that are executed from a GUI.

I would like to put at the service of those interested in debt problems a tool with which you can evaluate alternative fiscal policies, in order to find those that make the Greek debt sustainable, at the lowest cost in terms of welfare.

The file Wonk-0.0.2.py constructs a GUI under which you can select an economy, and then, by running "run experiment" from the menu Tools, you plot the long term budget constraint of the economy.

This files need to be improved so that they ca be deployed to several operating systems, and to construct the clases that render a more readable code.
